## Dataset
PJM Hourly Energy Consumption Data - https://www.kaggle.com/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption
PJM Interconnection is an  based in US. From the snippet below, it is easy to spot the daily and seasonal trends. That's just one region. There are few more regions. That's why I think it's a good data. The drawback of this data is that it has only two attributes - data and load. Some of the things that could be done with the data is
Building a model to predict energy consumption

## Motivations
- Building a model to predict energy consumption
- Find trends in energy consumption around hours of the day, holidays, or long term trends.
- Understand how daily trends change depending of the time of year.
